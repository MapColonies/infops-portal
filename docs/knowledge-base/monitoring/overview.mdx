# An Overview of Monitoring Stack

The monitoring stack is a Kubernetes-based stack used to observe, monitor, and alert on the health and performance metrics. It leverages open-source tools, including **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Blackbox Exporter**, **Alertmanager**, and **OpenTelemetry**.

# Prometheus

Prometheus serves as the primary component for collecting and storing metrics.
It is configured to scrape metrics from various sources, including itself, other pods with the correct labels, and the Blackbox Exporter, at intervals of 5 seconds with a 3-second timeout.
The default evaluation interval for rule execution is 30 seconds. Prometheus is integrated with Alertmanager to handle alerting, with alerts triggered based on predefined rules specified in `alerting_rules.yml`.

# BlackBox Exporter
This is an external probing tool that Prometheus uses to check the availability of endpoints such as Jenkins, Grafana, and SFTPGo.

# Alertmanager
Alertmanager is responsible for handling alerts sent by Prometheus. Using the `config map reloder` can reload configurations without restarting the pod.

# Grafana
Grafana provides the visualization layer for Prometheus metrics and Tempo traces.

# OpenTelemetry Collector
OpenTelemetry is used for collecting, processing, and exporting traces to Tempo.

# Tempo
Grafana Tempo is the distributed tracing backend. It collects and stores trace data in the s3 storage from OpenTelemetry and supports tracing workloads.
